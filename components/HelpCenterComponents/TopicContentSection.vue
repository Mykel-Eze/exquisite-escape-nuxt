                Change of plans? No problem. We’re here to help make things as easy as possible.
                Conveniently, you can cancel most flights online – including flights booked with points.
                Before you cancel
                Be sure to review the Airline rules + restrictions in your itinerary to see what the airline will let you do and what fees they charge for flight cancellations.
                Cancel with extenuating circumstances
                In some cases, you might be able to get a refund for non-refundable tickets if you canceled because of jury duty, a medical incident, death, or a change in military orders that would prevent you from traveling. You can fill out an extenuating circumstances refund formextenuating circumstances refund form to request a refund from your airline. Keep in mind that you’ll probably have to provide documentation outlining the circumstances of your request and that it’s up to the airline whether or not they issue a refund.

                <b>Low-cost airlines</b> <br>
                Low-cost airlines, like Frontier and Spirit, like to handle their own changes and cancellations.
                Roundtrip flights with 2 one-way fares
                Because each ticket is considered separate, be sure to cancel each of your one-way flights individually.
                If one of your flights is with a low-cost airline, like Frontier or Spirit, you’ll need to contact the airline to
                cancel that flight. (They like to do that part on their end.) You can cancel your other flight with us.

                how to cancel one part of a package and what to expect when you do.

                    <li>
                        If you miss or skip your departure flight, the airline will cancel your return flight. Unless you booked a roundtrip
                        flight with 2 one-way fares, because your tickets are considered separate in that case.
